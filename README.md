# AI_Models-Proj
A generic code of different AI models being implemented on Text, Numeric and Images Dataset

Overview
This repository contains implementations of different AI models applied to three distinct types of datasets. Each dataset represents a different domain:

Text Data: Implementations include natural language processing (NLP) models.
Numeric Data: Implementations include machine learning models for structured data.
Image Data: Implementations include computer vision models.
The goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding and applying various AI techniques across different data modalities.

Datasets
Text Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bjoernjostein/fake-news-data-set
Description: This dataset consists of textual data suitable for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, etc.
Numeric Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keyvanhamdi/huge-transactional-dataset
Description: This dataset contains structured numeric data suitable for regression, classification, or clustering tasks. We reduced this dataset to only 300k instances due to limited resources using a python script.
Image Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robinreni/revitsone-5class?resource=download
Description: This dataset includes images suitable for tasks like image classification, object detection, etc.
